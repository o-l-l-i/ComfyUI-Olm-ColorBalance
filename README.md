## ✨ What Is This?

**Olm Color Balance** is a fast, lightweight, and highly responsive color adjustment node for ComfyUI.
Inspired by typical art app "Color Balance" feature, it lets you fine-tune shadows, midtones, and highlights by shifting the RGB balance across the tonal range — all in real time.

If you’re tired of heavy multi-node bundles for this specific task, this tool is for you.

Use it for:

- Subtle or bold color grading
- Stylizing images to match a desired tone
- Matching images for compositing
- Emulating analog film or cinematic color response

---

## 🎯 Why Use This?

- 🧩 **Standalone and Focused**
  - Not part of a bulky node suite.

- ⚡ **Minimal Dependencies**
  - Built using only `Pillow`, `Torch`, and `NumPy`.
  - No extra models, weights, servers, or external assets.

- 🖼️ **Live Preview**
  - See the result directly in the node — no need to re-run the full graph for every tweak.

- 🧘 **Smooth UX**
  - Compact and neat.
  - Resize the node for larger sliders and preview image.
  - Everything responds immediately.

## 🎨 Features

### 🎛️ Classic Color Balance Controls

Each tonal range — **Shadows**, **Midtones**, and **Highlights** — has three sliders:

| Range     | Adjustable Channels   |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Shadows   | Cyan–Red, Magenta–Green, Yellow–Blue |
| Midtones  | Cyan–Red, Magenta–Green, Yellow–Blue |
| Highlights| Cyan–Red, Magenta–Green, Yellow–Blue |

All changes are applied smoothly, with tonemapped masks to isolate the ranges, producing smooth, natural-looking results.

### ⚡ Realtime Feedback

- Instantly updates preview inside the node.
- Designed for fast iteration and creative exploration.
- Fully resizable interface and slider layout.

## 📦 Installation

Clone this repository into your `custom_nodes` folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/o-l-l-i/ComfyUI-Olm-ColorBalance.git
```

Your folder structure should look like:

```bash
ComfyUI/
└── custom_nodes/
    └── ComfyUI-Olm-ColorBalance/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── olm_colorbalance.py
        └── ... (other files)
```

Restart ComfyUI to load the new node.

✅ No extra dependencies — works out of the box.

---

## 🧪 Basic Usage

1. Load an image using a Load Image node.
2. Connect it to the Olm Color Balance node.
3. Run the graph once to generate a preview image in the node.
4. Adjust the sliders under Shadows, Midtones, and Highlights to color-correct or stylize.
5. Observe real-time updates in the node’s preview area.
6. Use the output image as input to any other node in your workflow.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Realtime preview only activates after the graph is run once.
- Best results are obtained with uncompressed RGB images.
- Currently limited to RGB image inputs.
- No mask support/pass-through.
- Fine adjustments may be needed to avoid clipping in extreme highlights or shadows.
- This is a creative node — it doesn’t do automatic white balance/contrast correction etc.
- Performance is generally fast, but scales with image size.
